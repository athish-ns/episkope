EMAIL_PROVIDER=gmail
GMAIL_USER=your-email@gmail.com
GMAIL_PASSWORD=your-app-password
GMAIL_FROM_EMAIL=your-email@gmail.com
GMAIL_FROM_NAME=Rehabilitation Center System
ALLOWED_ORIGINS=http://localhost:3000

# Firebase Configuration
VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_firebase_api_key_here
VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your_project_id.firebaseapp.com
VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
VITE_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your_project_id.appspot.com
VITE_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your_messaging_sender_id
VITE_FIREBASE_APP_ID=your_app_id

# Groq AI Service

REACT_APP_GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key_here

# Application Configuration
VITE_APP_NAME=Rehabilitation Centre Management
VITE_APP_VERSION=1.0.0
```

**Important Security Notes:**
- Never commit your `.env` file to version control
- Use strong, unique passwords for all services
- Rotate API keys regularly
- Consider using a secrets management service in production

### Email Service
The system supports multiple email providers with Gmail as the default:

```javascript
// Email configuration in server.js
const emailConfig = {
  provider: 'gmail',
  gmail: {
    user: process.env.GMAIL_USER,
    password: process.env.GMAIL_PASSWORD,
    fromEmail: process.env.GMAIL_FROM_EMAIL,
    fromName: process.env.GMAIL_FROM_NAME
  }
};
```

### Firebase Configuration
Update `src/services/firebaseService.js` with your Firebase project details:

```javascript
const firebaseConfig = {
  apiKey: "your-api-key",
  authDomain: "your-project.firebaseapp.com",
  projectId: "your-project-id",
  storageBucket: "your-project.appspot.com",
  messagingSenderId: "your-sender-id",
  appId: "your-app-id"
};
```

### Groq AI Service Configuration
The system uses Groq AI for intelligent text summarization and injury assessment. Configure your API key:

```javascript
// Environment variable configuration
VITE_GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key_here
REACT_APP_GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key_here
```

**Note**: The service automatically detects whether you're using Vite or Create React App and uses the appropriate environment variable prefix.

### Rate Limiting
API protection with configurable rate limits:

```javascript
const limiter = rateLimit({
  windowMs: 15 * 60 * 1000, // 15 minutes
  max: 100, // 100 requests per window
  message: { error: 'Too many requests' }
});
```
